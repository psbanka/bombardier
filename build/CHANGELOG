The Bombardier project was started in 2004 and was released as an
Open-source project in 2005, but a full stable release was never made
to the public. The project continued development and was released
again to the open-source community in 2008.

The project has undergone significant rework and re-design. It started
out as a tool to assist in building machines for a testing
network. The main thrust of the project initially was something like,
"Go install software on a remote machine. If you have any trouble,
just keep doing as much as you can and then I'll check back later to
see what needs to be fixed." And while that was nice for sloppy
rack-and-stack deployments, it didn't really suit our needs in a
production environment.

For the 2008 release, the project had been transformed into a
production datacenter management tool. It focuses on deploying typical
datacenter software (e.g. Apache Tomcat, Apache HTTP server, Java,
Microsoft IIS, web applications, Microsoft SQL server databases, etc.)
in a very tightly controlled and repeatable way with a central
management console.

We took quite a bit of inspiration from ITIL in developing this
software, focusing on the Change Control practices defined there and
trying our best to make them as simple as easy to implement as
possible. ITIL itself can be very challenging to take hold of and
actually implement in a datacenter, and we believe that the Bombardier
software goes a long way towards making it possible to bite
off the Change Management piece and go all the way with it (it has for
our organization, anyway).

0.70
====
         Released to beta in November 2008. We had done extensive
         regression testing against the Bombardier code base and
         believed it to be ready for use. We have been using it in our
         QA environments and promoted it to our production datacenters.

         Besides bug-scrubbing, a few features were added:

          * Cleaned up traceback output and did some better exception
            handling.

          * Improved Sql Server functionality

          * Cleaned up the way communications are done with the client

          * Made the logic for determining when to send packages to
            client more robust.

1.00
====
668:     Alpha release of system. The 1.00 branch provides a
         centralized RESTful web server enabled with Django. This
         architecture change enables greater security, better
         reporting, and provides for adding quite a few additional
         services, such as monitoring system integration,
         load-balancer integration, and log management. Deprecated
         Windows compatibility



668: 2009-12-31 <peter.banka>
    An initial documentation set; far from complete

671: 2010-01-07 <root>
    Added Job control; cleaned up some logging and error
    handling; make reconnecting take less time

672: 2010-01-07 <peter.banka>
    Preparing for submission to PyPi

673: 2010-01-08 <shawn.sherwood>
    Made rsync throw if there is a problem.

675: 2010-01-12 <root>
    Increased pylint scores for Bombardier core; moved Spkg.py
    and Config.py into bombardier_core from bombardier_client.

678: 2010-01-12 <root>
    Added a MANIFEST.in file, added a long description to
    setup.py, added some clean to make.sh.

681: 2010-01-12 <root>
    Created a build directory, and a rough make file. Moved
    some the files like AUTHORS and LICENSE into build.

683: 2010-01-12 <root>
    Removed cli from setup.py for server.

685: 2010-01-13 <root>
    Removed some a useless component within Client
    (utility.py) and moved a couple of them over to core
    (PluggableFileProcessor and FileManifest). Cleaned up
    client pylint scores and Shawn worked on the Makefile.

691: 2010-01-13 <U-ES-BC9QP81\2080...>
    Cleaned out some old packages not needed for tests and
    worked on some client tests; only need to complete
    BombardierClass.

692: 2010-01-14 <U-ES-BC9QP81\2080...>
    Significant changes in BombardierClass based on unit-test
    completion: Performing better dependency checking for
    already-installed packages; better logging, especially
    during check_system; better initialization if methods in
    BombardierClass are being called sequentially if the object
    is not destroyed. Slightly better logging if a package is
    not found. Made Config a little more tolerant of not
    finding a saved config hash. Added a few dinky test
    packages.

693: 2010-01-14 <U-ES-BC9QP81\2080...>
    Basic documentation

694: 2010-01-14 <U-ES-BC9QP81\2080...>
    Fixed up setup for import to PyPi

710: 2010-01-19 <U-scruffy\Peter>
    Debugging quickstart; adding to setup.py scripts

713: 2010-01-20 <root>
    Trying to be more defensive when parsing output from login

714: 2010-01-21 <root>
    More defensive in parsing JSON output; Not always asking
    to disconnect clients. Handling ^C better when initially
    logging in. Asking the user to set server_home if it is not
    configured in the CNM.

715: 2010-01-21 <U-ES-BC9QP81\2080...>
    Cleaned up documentation significantly; made a correct
    banner for this version of the cli; fixed up the
    quick-install script

717: 2010-01-25 <shawn.sherwood>
    Corrected at virtual package dependency resolution. Added
    a test. Fixed classes inside pkg2 and pkg3 spkg files.

720: 2010-01-27 <root>
    Better logging in the client; better exception processing
    in Spkg; cleaned up the banner

727: 2010-02-03 <root>
    First shot at making a job queue

728: 2010-02-22 <root>
    Added m to the options on tar to throw away timestamps in
    the tarball. This negates the effects of incorrect time on
    the client machine.

729: 2010-02-22 <root>
    Checking in this import try/except for machines with no
    pycrypto.

730: 2010-03-02 <root>
    Implemented a Job scheduler in the form of
    DispatchMonitor. This thing keeps track of current jobs and
    fires off new ones when the time is right. It also keeps
    track of finished and broken ones. Plus, it's got your back
    if you get freaked out and want to stop everything.  This
    required some changes in the CLI code to be able to track
    the next job in a sequence of jobs. Also added some other
    job management commands on the CLI to view active/finished
    jobs and clear out old broken jobs. Also fixed the help on
    the Create command. Also, got a little more defensive about
    handling exceptions in jobs and clearing a job from a
    machine object. Got Pyro to dump tracebacks from Dispatcher
    more efficiently. Stopped passing back Dispatcher objects
    through pyro because they can no longer be serialized due
    to the fact that they have a thread object now. Added a
    machine 'setup' command which does all the hard work for a
    guy, sending the dists, enabling, and firing up bombardier
    for the first time.

731: 2010-03-09 <root>
    Added User management features:this required support for
    the DELETE method. Will need to be able to support delete
    for other high-level objects. Added a Comment feature. BDR
    now keeps track of jobs that haven't been commented and
    notifies the user of the jobs that need comments applied.
    The COMMENT command will bring up the editor to allow the
    user to enter comments and select which jobs the comments
    apply to. Factored the Dispatcher module into its component
    parts: Commands, Job, DispatchMonitor, and ServerLogMixin.

731.1.2: 2010-03-12 <root>
    Re-organized the command-structure of the CLI. Cleaned up
    how server tracebacks were done. Fixed up Merge command so
    that it works properly in the server. Added the ability to
    have job-watcher trap a ^C and properly kill a job if it's
    necessary. Cleaned up how help was done, and avoided
    needless repetition when setting up commands. Cleaned out
    the CLI commands within bdr so that they don't annoy the
    user

733: 2010-03-15 <root>
    Changed how verbose job-watching is. Tried to provide
    succinct user output, and to always provide summary data at
    the end of a command. Fixed a bug with setting comments.
    Hopefully removed all sign of 'command_status' showing up
    in the output of commands. Starting to experience a problem
    where the CnmConnector is asking for jobs to be joined
    before they're ready. Not sure what's happening. It logs
    when this occurs.

734: 2010-03-16 <U-GECORPORATE\208...>
    Finished basic stuff for tutorial02.txt

735: 2010-03-19 <root>

    Implemented the bombardierinstaller.org website via Google
    AppEngine

738: 2010-03-22 <root>
    Finished makefile target for docs.

739: 2010-03-26 <U-GECORPORATE\208...>
    Nice-looking documentation content, etc. Ready to publish.

    in some code from
    http://stacyprowell.com/blog/2009/03/30/trapping-ctrlc-in-python/

745: 2010-04-07 <root>
    Fixed bug 557575

746: 2010-04-07 <root>
    Fixed bug #557610

747: 2010-04-08 <root>
    Marginally compatible with python2.4. Included proper
    templates in the build. Ensured that pysqlite was dependent
    for the server system

748: 2010-04-08 <root>
    Some minor python2.4 fixes. Some documentation fixes, and
    some build fixes.

750: 2010-04-08 <root>
    Peter made a change to setup.py for server. Added a new
    target for cleaning distutils files after an upload.

752: 2010-05-24 <root>
    Fixed some issues with how job names are retained when
    terminating a session. Fixed build process so that it
    creates an injector directory

753: 2010-05-26 <root>
    Changed 'Packages to be RECONFIGURED' to a dictionary.

754: 2010-06-04 <U-GECORPORATE\208...>
    Documentation changes. Fixed up the FAQ a bit.

755: 2010-06-04 <root>
    Removed all references to syck (hope it doesn't make us
    sad). Fixed old problem with TestPackageType4-7.spkg that
    we never knew about. Made Exit command work at all levels.
    Modified Makefile to be able to upload to launchpad
    automagically

757: 2010-06-04 <root>
    Setting the Launchpad production environment as the
    default in the uploader

    fixing minor problem in launchpad uploader

759: 2010-06-14 <root>
    about to perform a major change in factoring components of
    Machine into CnmConnector

760: 2010-06-29 <root>
    [merge] Separated dispatcher from the rest of the rest web
    interface.

759.1.1: 2010-06-16 <root>
    Checkpoint. The dispatcher stops and starts under apache
    without leaving zombies.

759.1.2: 2010-06-17 <root>
    Proper URLs. Importing missing components. Better error
    reporting. Cleaned up how parent PIDs were monitored and
    how server home is used. Did some better input
    sanitization.

759.1.3: 2010-06-23 <root>
    Checkpoint: We can start the dispatcher, start apache, and
    log in to bdr.

759.1.4: 2010-06-29 <root>
    refactored the command-line components into a CommandLine
    object. Added the background-flag option for the
    command-line. Fixed a race-condition which was breaking a
    unit-test. All the unit tests are passing on the
    server-side code after breaking out the dis-patcher.

759.1.5: 2010-06-29 <root>
    Added versioning capability. Removed excess logging.

761: 2010-06-30 <root>
