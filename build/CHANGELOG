The Bombardier project was started in 2004 and was released as an
Open-source project in 2005, but a full stable release was never made
to the public. The project continued development and was released
again to the open-source community in 2008.

The project has undergone significant rework and re-design. It started
out as a tool to assist in building machines for a testing
network. The main thrust of the project initially was something like,
"Go install software on a remote machine. If you have any trouble,
just keep doing as much as you can and then I'll check back later to
see what needs to be fixed." And while that was nice for sloppy
rack-and-stack deployments, it didn't really suit our needs in a
production environment.

For the 2008 release, the project had been transformed into a
production datacenter management tool. It focuses on deploying typical
datacenter software (e.g. Apache Tomcat, Apache HTTP server, Java,
Microsoft IIS, web applications, Microsoft SQL server databases, etc.)
in a very tightly controlled and repeatable way with a central
management console.

We took quite a bit of inspiration from ITIL in developing this
software, focusing on the Change Control practices defined there and
trying our best to make them as simple as easy to implement as
possible. ITIL itself can be very challenging to take hold of and
actually implement in a datacenter, and we believe that the Bombardier
software goes a long way towards making it possible to bite
off the Change Management piece and go all the way with it (it has for
our organization, anyway).

Bombardier 0.70 series
======================

598: 2009-10-21 <shawn.sherwood>
    Released to beta in November 2008. We had done extensive
    regression testing against the Bombardier code base and
    believed it to be ready for use. We have been using it in our
    QA environments and promoted it to our production datacenters.

    Besides bug-scrubbing, a few features were added:

     * Cleaned up traceback output and did some better exception
       handling.

     * Improved Sql Server functionality

     * Cleaned up the way communications are done with the client

     * Made the logic for determining when to send packages to
       client more robust.

Bombardier 1.00 series
======================
668: 2009-12-31 <peter.banka>
    * Alpha release of system. The 1.00 branch provides a
      centralized RESTful web server enabled with Django. This
      architecture change enables greater security, better
      reporting, and provides for adding quite a few additional
      services, such as monitoring system integration,
      load-balancer integration, and log management. Deprecated
      Windows compatibility

    * An initial documentation set; far from complete

692: 2010-01-14 <peter.banka>
    * Added Job control; cleaned up some logging and error
      handling; make reconnecting take less time

    * Preparing for submission to PyPi

    * Made rsync throw if there is a problem.

    * Increased pylint scores for Bombardier core; moved Spkg.py
      and Config.py into bombardier_core from bombardier_client.

    * Created a build directory, and a rough make file. Moved
      some the files like AUTHORS and LICENSE into build.

    * Removed cli from setup.py for server.

    * Significant changes in BombardierClass based on unit-test
      completion: Performing better dependency checking for
      already-installed packages; better logging, especially
      during check_system; better initialization if methods in
      BombardierClass are being called sequentially if the object
      is not destroyed. Slightly better logging if a package is
      not found. Made Config a little more tolerant of not
      finding a saved config hash. Added a few dinky test
      packages.

717: 2010-01-25 <shawn.sherwood>
    * Basic documentation

    * Fixed up setup for import to PyPi

    * Added some basic documentation for the CLI

    * Added documentation around package creation

    * Creating some documentation and the quickstart script

    * More defensive in parsing JSON output; Not always asking
      to disconnect clients. Handling ^C better when initially
      logging in. Asking the user to set server_home if it is not
      configured in the CNM.

    * Cleaned up documentation significantly; made a correct
      banner for this version of the cli; fixed up the
      quick-install script

    * Corrected at virtual package dependency resolution. Added
      a test. Fixed classes inside pkg2 and pkg3 spkg files.

730: 2010-03-02 <peter.banka>
    * Better logging in the client; better exception processing
      in Spkg; cleaned up the banner

    * First shot at making a job queue

    * Added m to the options on tar to throw away timestamps in
      the tarball. This negates the effects of incorrect time on
      the client machine.

    * Checking in this import try/except for machines with no
      pycrypto.

    * Implemented a Job scheduler in the form of
      DispatchMonitor. This thing keeps track of current jobs and
      fires off new ones when the time is right. It also keeps
      track of finished and broken ones. Plus, it's got your back
      if you get freaked out and want to stop everything.  This
      required some changes in the CLI code to be able to track
      the next job in a sequence of jobs. Also added some other
      job management commands on the CLI to view active/finished
      jobs and clear out old broken jobs. Also fixed the help on
      the Create command. Also, got a little more defensive about
      handling exceptions in jobs and clearing a job from a
      machine object. Got Pyro to dump tracebacks from Dispatcher
      more efficiently. Stopped passing back Dispatcher objects
      through pyro because they can no longer be serialized due
      to the fact that they have a thread object now. Added a
      machine 'setup' command which does all the hard work for a
      guy, sending the dists, enabling, and firing up bombardier
      for the first time.

734: 2010-03-16 <peter.banka>
    * Added User management features:this required support for
      the DELETE method. Will need to be able to support delete
      for other high-level objects. Added a Comment feature. BDR
      now keeps track of jobs that haven't been commented and
      notifies the user of the jobs that need comments applied.
      The COMMENT command will bring up the editor to allow the
      user to enter comments and select which jobs the comments
      apply to. Factored the Dispatcher module into its component
      parts: Commands, Job, DispatchMonitor, and ServerLogMixin.

    * Re-organized the command-structure of the CLI. Cleaned up
      how server tracebacks were done. Fixed up Merge command so
      that it works properly in the server. Added the ability to
      have job-watcher trap a ^C and properly kill a job if it's
      necessary. Cleaned up how help was done, and avoided
      needless repetition when setting up commands. Cleaned out
      the CLI commands within bdr so that they don't annoy the
      user

    * Changed how verbose job-watching is. Tried to provide
      succinct user output, and to always provide summary data at
      the end of a command. Fixed a bug with setting comments.
      Hopefully removed all sign of 'command_status' showing up
      in the output of commands. Starting to experience a problem
      where the CnmConnector is asking for jobs to be joined
      before they're ready. Not sure what's happening. It logs
      when this occurs.

    * Finished basic stuff for tutorial02.txt

739: 2010-03-26 <peter.banka>
    * Added package assignment

    * Implemented the bombardierinstaller.org website via Google
      AppEngine

    * Finished makefile target for docs.

    * Nice-looking documentation content, etc. Ready to publish.

746: 2010-04-07 <peter.banka>
    * Hopefully fixed building problem. Also addressed bug
      #557469

    * Fixed bug 557470. Now issues a warning when something is
      queued. Should also fix 557477

    * Fixed bug #557581

    * Fixed bug #557480

    * Fixed bug 557478 and cleaned up CnmConnector. Also brought
      in some code from
      http://stacyprowell.com/blog/2009/03/30/trapping-ctrlc-in-python/

    * Fixed bug 557575

    * Fixed bug #557610

753: 2010-05-26 <shawn.sherwood>
    * Marginally compatible with python2.4. Included proper
    templates in the build. Ensured that pysqlite was dependent
    for the server system

    * Some minor python2.4 fixes. Some documentation fixes, and
    some build fixes.

    * Peter made a change to setup.py for server. Added a new
    target for cleaning distutils files after an upload.

    * Fixed some issues with how job names are retained when
    terminating a session. Fixed build process so that it
    creates an injector directory

    * Changed 'Packages to be RECONFIGURED' to a dictionary.

759: 2010-06-14 <peter.banka>
    * Documentation changes. Fixed up the FAQ a bit.

    * Removed all references to syck (hope it doesn't make us
      sad). Fixed old problem with TestPackageType4-7.spkg that
      we never knew about. Made Exit command work at all levels.
      Modified Makefile to be able to upload to launchpad
      automagically

    * Setting the Launchpad production environment as the
      default in the uploader

    * fixing minor problem in launchpad uploader

    * about to perform a major change in factoring components of
      Machine into CnmConnector

760: 2010-06-29 <peter.banka>
    [merge] Separated dispatcher from the rest of the rest web
    interface.

      * Checkpoint. The dispatcher stops and starts under apache
        without leaving zombies.

      * Proper URLs. Importing missing components. Better error
        reporting. Cleaned up how parent PIDs were monitored and
        how server home is used. Did some better input
        sanitization.

      * Checkpoint: We can start the dispatcher, start apache, and
        log in to bdr.

      * refactored the command-line components into a CommandLine
        object. Added the background-flag option for the
        command-line. Fixed a race-condition which was breaking a
        unit-test. All the unit tests are passing on the
        server-side code after breaking out the dis-patcher.

      * Added versioning capability. Removed excess logging.

763: 2010-07-07 <shawn.sherwood>
    * bdr_admin now does automatic upgrades!

    * Corrected shebang.

    * Added rough dpkg script and files.
