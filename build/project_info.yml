long_description: "Bombardier is a command-line system that allows a system admins\
  \ to manage a\nlarge number of computers in his or her datacenter over ssh. You\
  \ can compare\nBombardier to Chef (www.opscode.com) or ControlTier (www.controltier.org).\n\
  Bombardier has a more secure than either of those systems and provides a\nbetter\
  \ user interface (command-line) that (we think) most system\nadministrators will\
  \ prefer for daily work to web-based interfaces (which\nyou are limited to with\
  \ the other products). \n.\nFor common tasks such as deploying software or making\
  \ changes to system\nconfiguration, this tool can make these tasks a lot faster\
  \ and a lot more\nreliable. The basic approach is to drive automated SSH sessions\
  \ over expect.\n.\nThere are three major pieces of code to this thing:\n# A \"client,\"\
  \ which installs on the computers you want to manage. The client\n  does not run\
  \ as a service, it is more accurately described as client-side\n  libraries. The\
  \ client software can be automatically installed by the server.\n# (THIS PACKAGE)A\
  \ server, which runs under Apache and provides a ReST\n  interface, and a daemon.\
  \ The daemon is responsible for managing ssh\n  connections to the computers in\
  \ the network.\n# A command-line interfce (CLI), which provides an efficient Cisco-style\n\
  \  command-line for driving the whole system. \n"
