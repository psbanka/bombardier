Thanks for downloading this bombardier component.

To install it, make sure you have Python 2.3 or greater installed. Then run
this command from the command prompt:

    python setup.py install

To get rid of some duplication, we now copy in setup.py from
build/proto_setup.py, along with project_info.yml.
