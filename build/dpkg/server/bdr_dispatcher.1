.SH NAME
bdr_dispatcher
.SH DESCRIPTION

.P
The bdr_dispatcher is a daemon that provides the core services of the
Bombardier server system. It is configured with the \fI/etc/bombardier.yml\fR
file, which specifies the server-home directory that the bdr_dispatcher
daemon runs out of. The server-home directory can also be specified on
the command-line. This daemon is responsible for issuing commands to
computers (or "machines") throughout the network. In addition, it provides the
following services: (1) connects to remote machines in your network via ssh
and holds on to the connections in a connection-pool, (2) is responsible for
all the configuration data for machines, include files, and packages,
(3) is responsible for building new packages, (4) performs actions on remote
machines throughout the network via the ssh connections that it maintains,
(5) maintains a central change-log of all actions performed on the network
in \fI/var/user.log\fR.

Individual Configuration Items (CIs) in a machine's configuration can be
encrypted. For example, you may choose to leave the IP address of a
machine readable by eveyone, but perhaps you have an Oracle 10g
package which installs and manages the database. In this case, you may
choose to encrypt the dba password and leave other configuration data
intact. The selective encryption of these items requires the daemon to
possess a decryption key. That key must be entered after starting the
bdr_dispatcher daemon. It can optionally be added on the command-line,
but that's not recommended, as the key will show up in the process
table. It is set by bdr_admin.
