Bombardier is a centralized, cross-platform package deployment,
configuration and change management system.

This is a fairly small component of the overall system, and is a
dependency of the client, server, and cli components.

Docs are updated rigorously. If you find any problems in the docs, or think they
should be clarified in any way, please take 30 seconds to fill out a ticket
