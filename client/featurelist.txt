<h1> UBERCLIENT </h1>
<dl>
<di>A-la-carte feature: Checkbox to pick only a-la-carte. This would
  direct the user to the server, where they would be able to pick
  their BOM. They would, in fact, be able to select a group of BOMs.

<di>Convert "TYPE" to "PACKAGE LIST": package0=foo, package1=bar,
  etc.

<di>Create a "base" package, which would be applied if the system is
  *not* a-la-carte.

<di>Create a "platform" field in each package which would specify the
  platform that the package is for. 

<di>Create intelligence in the client not to install any packages that
  are not compatible with its platform. The shortcut on this is just
  to pretend that we installed it properly.

<di>Revamp the installer not to ask so many questions

<di>Have the installer create the "drillbit" user as a local
  administrator and always use that for future logins.

<di>Server-side UI for a-la-carte client package selection and
  configuration. 

<di>Publish all configuration options necessary for all packages, as
  part of their config.ini file. 

<di>Create the ability to change the repository for a client.
</dl>

<h1>Patch management</h1>

<dl>
<di>Create a post-deps configuration item for patching buggy software
  (i.e. Internet Explorer)
</dl>

<h1>Server management UI</h1>

<dl>
<di>Package Deployment penetration : package name as argument, servers
    that have the package installed and servers that don't have the
    package installed (servers pending)

<di> Client status: select a client, package installation history as
    output.

<di>  Bad-client report: show clients that are behind schedule for
    package installation.

<di> Provide an interface for modifying key components of a package's
   .ini-file.  (n+1)

<di> Provide a report which shows all client inventory, with dates for
   each package. (n+1)

<h1>Linux client</h1>

<dl>
<di> Make a service that runs on a Linux server which checks with the
    bombardier server for packages that should be installed,
    interrogates the native package management system, and directs the
    system to install packages as needed.
</dl>

<h1>Top Windows client features to add</h1>
<dl>
<di>Make ALL configuration files editable using notepad or some crap.

<di>Make the client upload information when it hits a bad package.

<di>provide a timestamp for each installed package in
   install-progress.txt.

<di>Modify packages to have a "criticality" rating (non-critical
   packages can be skipped without stopping the installation process)

<di>Make sure all hotfix packages are uninstallable.

<di>Need full unit testing framework rebuilt

<di>Remove the need to create tarballs which are then unpacked. Do this
   in a single step. This would speed up deployment and reduce disk
   space. 

<di>Remove the need to have a "dash-version" on a package name. This
   would reduce complexity and provide for fewer mistakes in BOM.txt
   and install-progress.txt. Replace this functionality with etags on
   the server.

<di>Tie a revision number to every single release of the Bombardier
   client software. Preferably the SVN history number. Do a SVN commit
   as part of any release.

<di>Establish a server interface which allows you to take feeds and
   deploy packages out to clients. This would finalize the "patch
   management" system. Consider RSS. 

<di>Establish a service on the client which performs backups and PUTs
   them on the server. And then have the server create a restore
   package and somehow modify the bill of materials for that
   client. When you download a file, see if there is a server-specific
   (backup, server-specific, global).

<di>Establish a server console which monitors the progress of a client
   installation.

<di>Make configurations look more like Cisco "show run", probably with
   YAML. Should these be hierarchichal? 

<di>Perfect the hotfix qchain loading system: respect returncode 2

<di>Clean up final reboot

<di>Don't overwrite install-progress on installation.

<di>Remove all sign of os.chdir() throughout the client, unless
   <strong>absolutely</strong> necessary
</dl>

<h1>Package problems</h1>

<dl>
<di>Hotsync manager fails to install except manually

<di>MDAC 2.7 dependency of ks-security-offline

<di>ie6 reboot problem

<di>hotfix doesn't reboot after qchaining

<di>Dot-net 1.1 dependency of offline-install

<di>Excel has a corrupted file in Windows/ShellNew/Binder.OBD

<di>Change the priority of offline-template so that it is *DEAD
   LAST*. Make all others in laptop dependencies of it.
</dl>
