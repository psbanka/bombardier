Bombardier CORE documentation
=============================

These modules are shared components between the various parts of the
Bombardier system, which comprise the following:

* Bombardier Server: The server provides centralized configuration
  data, definitive software library, a job dispatcher, and change
  revision history.  Authentication to this server is granted only to
  administrators of the network. All interaction with the server is
  done through a REST interface.

* Bombardier Command-line interface (CLI): This is a tool that the
  network administrator uses to control the Bombardier server. The CLI
  can exist on the same physical machine as the Bombardier Server or
  on a separate one. The CLI communicates to the Server via a
  web-based REST interface.

* Bombardier Client: This is code that resides on machines throughout
  your network that you want to control with the Bombardier
  system. When a network administrator wants something to happen on
  the network, he or she will start up the CLI, which issues commands
  to the Server, which in turn reaches out to one or more machines in
  the network via SSH. When the server connects to each machine, it
  relies upon code in the Bombardier Client to make things happen
  efficiently. The client does not run as a daemon, but only is used
  when activated by the server through SSH.

* Bombardier Core: (this distribution) which doesn't do anything,
  really, only provides support modules for each of the other
  components.
