.SH OPTIONS

.HP
init Initialize a new bombardier server system. Verifies that directories are in the correct places and that ssh keys are correct. Also creates the \fI/etc/bombardier.yml\fR file.

.HP
set-password This sets the configuration-key on the bombardier dispatcher. This key is used to selectively encrypt configuration items.

.HP
\fISERVER_HOME\fR The path to the bombardier server configuration management database (defaults to \fI/var/deploy\fR)
