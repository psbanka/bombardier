<h1>What is Bombardier?</h1>

<h2>An automated deployment system</h2>

<ul>

<li> Bombardier is a system for automatically deploying packages to
     Windows-based computers (Windows 2000 Professional and Windows
     2000 server currently have been tested). Specifically, it is
     designed to deploy Microsoft hotfixes from a centralized server
     using a <a
     href=http://www.xfront.com/REST-Web-Services.html>RESTful</a>
     design. </p>

<li> Bombardier is intended to make all IT services deployed on
     Windows systems completely transparent. This means that the
     packages that are deployed provide a means of
     self-documentation. It can now become clear how something was
     installed merely by looking at the packages that compose the
     system. 

<li> No Backups. No Images. Nothing concealed or obfuscated. No untidy
     messes that need to be dealt with. Bombardier drives a new level
     of quality into system management.

</ul>

<h2>An automated test validation system</h2>

<ul>

<li> The purpose of Bombardier, besides being a package manager, is to
     provide a means of creating "unit-tests" for system-level
     components.

<li> These unit tests are automatically run whenever software is
     installed to ensure that the software was installed properly. 

<li> The testing scaffolding is left in place after the system has
     been deployed in order to continue to test the system in the
     future. All package-based tests can be exercised on a regular
     basis to validate that a server is performing optimally (or, if
     it isn&rsquo;t &mdash; to know precisely where the server is
     failing.</p>
