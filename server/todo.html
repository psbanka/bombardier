<h1>Major features to add to the system</h1>

<h2> Windows client </h2>

<ol>

<li> There is apparently some kind of nasty object leak or something
     in BombardierClientService.py, because when you try to stop the
     service after some time of it working properly, it either locks
     the system or causes the power to dim for a while during its
     shutdown process.

<li> Create a "platform" field in each package which would specify the
     platform that the package is for. 

<li> Create intelligence in the client not to install any packages that
     are not compatible with its platform. The shortcut on this is just
     to pretend that we installed it properly.

<li> Have all clients implement a status file, which they put on the
     server. This flag would indicate either COMPLETE, INCOMPLETE (packages),
     or FAILED (bad-package-name)

<li> GUI: Have a graphic status bar instead of the text log which indicates:
     Status, current package, packages left (in order, preferrably!)

<li> Create the ability to change the repository for a client.

<li> Create a "virtual" package, which can be substituted by one ore
     more "real" packages. This way one or more packages could satisfy
     a dependency. (MSDE vs. SQL Server, e.g.)

<li> Create a post-dependency field for any package, which specifies
     those packages which must be added to a BOM if this package is
     added (primarily used for patch management). System should check
     the post-dependencies of every package that has been installed in
     the system to see if it should install new bug-fixes.

<li> Make ALL configuration files editable using notepad or some crap.

<li> Make the client upload information when it hits a bad package.

<li> Modify packages to have a "criticality" rating (non-critical
     packages can be skipped without stopping the installation
     process). Critical packages will cause an installation to halt.

<li> Remove the need to create tarballs which are then unpacked. Do this
     in a single step. This would speed up deployment and reduce disk
     space. 

<li> Tie a revision number to every single release of the Bombardier
     client software. Preferably the SVN history number. Do a SVN commit
     as part of any release.

<li> Establish a service on the client which performs backups and PUTs
     them on the server. And then have the server create a restore
     package and somehow modify the bill of materials for that
     client. When you download a file, see if there is a server-specific
     (backup, server-specific, global).

<li> Establish a server console which monitors the progress of a client
     installation.

<li> Make configurations look more like Cisco "show run", probably with
     YAML. Should these be hierarchichal? 

<li> Perfect the hotfix qchain loading system: respect returncode 2

<li> Remove all sign of os.chdir() throughout the client, unless
     <strong>absolutely</strong> necessary

</ol>

<h2>Server management UI</h2>

<ol>

<li> An interface that shows client status and last reported IP address.

<li> Package Deployment penetration : package name as argument, servers
     that have the package installed and servers that don't have the
     package installed (servers pending)

<li> Client status: select a client, package installation history as
     output.

<li> Bad-client report: show clients that are behind schedule for
     package installation.

<li> Provide a report which shows all client inventory, with dates for
     each package. (n+1)

<li> Need full unit testing framework built for the server web site.

<li> Establish a server interface which allows you to take feeds and
     deploy packages out to clients. This would finalize the "patch
     management" system. Consider RSS. 

</ol>

<h2>Linux client</h2>

<ol>

<li> Make a service that runs on a Linux server which checks with the
     bombardier server for packages that should be installed,
     interrogates the native package management system, and directs the
     system to install packages as needed.

</ol>

<h2> Package Problems </h2>

<ol>

<li> sql2ksp3: This guy can sometimes pop up a windows that is
     unexpected and halts the install. It mentions some nonsense about
     services that are already running that you should really shut off
     before continuing.

<li> cygwin package that installs a service that runs as a domain user 
     which will ensure that sshd is running and that the /etc/passwd and
     group files are in sync with the domain.

<li> KeyAdvantage Client Needed

<li> KIM Client Needed

<li> Clientele 7.1 Needed

<li> ks-security-4.2.1557.30760 does not install properly. Probably
     due to a console problem.

<li> user-ks-security doesn't install/verify properly. Need to look at
     how user accounts are created.

<li> <strong>SupraNet</strong> does not install the ADODB.DLL file in
     the SupraNet/Bin directory

<li> Textpad is still having difficulties installing. It has been
     removed from the base items list.

<li> Hotsync manager fails to install except manually

<li> MDAC 2.7 dependency of ks-security-offline

<li> ie6 reboot problem

<li> hotfix doesn't reboot after qchaining

<li> Dot-net 1.1 dependency of offline-install

<li> Excel has a corrupted file in Windows/ShellNew/Binder.OBD

<li> Change the priority of offline-template so that it is *DEAD
     LAST*. Make all others in laptop dependencies of it.

</ol>
