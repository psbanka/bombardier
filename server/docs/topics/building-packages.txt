====================
Building the package
====================

You now have the basic ingredients for this example package, which
are:

 1. The package configuration file

 2. The libraries that will be used to install and configure the
    package

 3. Any and all files that you would like to bundle with the package
    (i.e. 'injectors')

It's now time to 'build' the package on the Bombardier Server through
the command-line interface.

When you issue the build command, the Bombardier server will examine
the package configuration data, check out any parts of the package from
the SVN repository that are necessary, and evaluate whether or not the
package is ready to be deployed. This is done with the package / build
command, as follows::

  peacemaker (admin)> pack SnmpConfigV5 build
  svn user []:
  svn password:
  >>> Job name: admin@CNM_Server-5
    |   admin@CNM_Server-5 | Checking out and building SnmpConfigV5...
    |   admin@CNM_Server-5 | --- /tmp/tmpMenc_j/libs/SnmpConfigV5/snmp_template.py
    |   admin@CNM_Server-5 | --- /tmp/tmpMenc_j/libs/SnmpConfigV5/SnmpConfigV5.py
    |   admin@CNM_Server-5 | --- /tmp/tmpMenc_j/libs/SnmpConfigV5/__init__.py
    |   admin@CNM_Server-5 | Checking out and building YumPackageInstaller...
    |   admin@CNM_Server-5 | --- /tmp/tmpMenc_j/libs/YumPackageInstaller/__init__.py
    |   admin@CNM_Server-5 | --- /tmp/tmpMenc_j/libs/YumPackageInstaller/YumPackageInstaller.py
    |   admin@CNM_Server-5 | My current directory: /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/bombardier_server/web/cnm
    |   admin@CNM_Server-5 | Package does not contain any metadata
    |   admin@CNM_Server-5 | Note: not deleting /tmp/tmpMenc_j
  >>> Joining...
    built /var/deploy/repos/libs/SnmpConfigV5-672.tar.gz
    built /var/deploy/repos/libs/YumPackageInstaller-672.tar.gz

At this point, the Bombardier Server is ready to be able to associate
this package with a machine on your network to configure it.  When the
Bombardier server examined the package, it added some information to
the package configuration file.  To see what it added, show the
package definition again:


  peacemaker (admin)> sho pack SnmpConfigV5
    class_name: SnmpConfigV5.SnmpConfigV5
    configuration:
      snmp:
        community_string: public
        location: UNDEFINED
        contact: NOBODY@EXAMPLE.COM
    dependencies: []
    executables:
    - configure
    - ensure_snmp
    - handle_backup_snmp
    - install
    - uninstall
    - verify
    injectors: {}
    libs:
      SnmpConfigV5:
        path: /var/deploy/repos/libs/SnmpConfigV5-672.tar.gz
        svn: 'http://www.bombardierinstaller.org/svn/pkg/SnmpConfigV5'
        version: '672'
      YumPackageInstaller:
        path: /var/deploy/repos/libs/YumPackageInstaller-672.tar.gz
        svn: 'http://www.bombardierinstaller.org/svn/pkg/YumPackageInstaller'
        version: '672'
    package-version: 5
    release: 4
    virtualpackage: SnmpConfigV5

You'll notice that the build system added a "configuration" section to
this package; that specifies the configuration values that are
required when this package is associated with a machine. The build
also added a number of entries to the "executables" section.
