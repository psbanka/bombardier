Bombardier.. _intro-install:

Quick install guide
===================

Before you can use Bombardier, you'll need to get it installed. We have a
:ref:`complete installation guide <topics-install>` that covers all the
possibilities; this guide will guide you to a simple, minimal installation
that'll work while you walk through the introduction.

Install Python
--------------

Bombardier is built on top of Python.  There are several components to
the Bombardier system: 

 * the Bombardier Server (bombardier_server)
 * the Bombardier Client (bombardier_client)
 * the Bombardier Command-line Interface (bombardier_cli)
 * and the Bombardier shared components (bombardier_core)

These will run under Python_ 2.5 or 2.6. The Bombardier Client, which
can run on any version of Python from 2.4 through 2.6.

.. admonition:: Platforms supported by Bombardier

    Bombardier has been thoroughly tested and developed on Redhat
    (Centos) Enterprise Linux 5 and Ubuntu Linux 8.10.  If you choose
    to install Bombardier onto other flavors of Linux or Unix or other
    POSIX operating systems, we can't guarantee it will work, but we'd
    love to hear from you and help you work through any issues.  If
    you need help with other platforms, send a message to
    `bombardier-users`__.

You can verify that Python's installed by typing ``python`` from your
shell; you should see something like::

    Python 2.5.1 (r251:54863, Jan 17 2008, 19:35:17) 
    [GCC 4.0.1 (Apple Inc. build 5465)] on darwin
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

Install Python Libraries
------------------------------------

In addition, Bombardier Server requires several Python libraries to be
installed as a pre-requisite. We recommend using `setuptools`_ to
quickly and easily download Bombardier Server and the python
pre-requisites that are required.:

  easy_install bombardier_cli

This will provide the Bombardier Server software, as well as all the
dependencies it requires.
