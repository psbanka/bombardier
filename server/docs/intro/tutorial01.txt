============================================
Deploying your first package with Bombardier
============================================

Let's learn by example.  Refer to the diagram below for what the
network will look like in general.  If your network doesn't look
exactly like this, that's okay.  Interpret the instructions for
your environment.

   :alt: Basic network configuration

In this example, we're going to take a network as shown above and
configure all the servers on it for SNMP. Here's what you're going to
need before you start this tutorial:

  * A Redhat 5, Ubuntu Hardy, or cygwin 1.5 or 1.7 computer that will
    act as the Bombardier server

  * A Redhat 5 or CentOS 5 computer that you want to configure SNMP on
    using a Bomabardier package.

We'll assume you have :ref:`Bombardier installed <intro-install>`
already. You can tell Bombardier is installed by running the
interactive interpreter and typing ``import bombardier_server``. If
that command runs successfully, with no errors, Bombardier server is
installed.

.. admonition:: Where to get help:

    If you're having trouble going through this tutorial, please post
    a message to `bombardier-users`__ to interact with other
    Bombardier users who might be able to help.

Starting the server
===================

If this is your first time using Bomabardie, you'll have to take care of some
initial setup. Namely, you'll need to set up the basic repository
database and an SVN server.
