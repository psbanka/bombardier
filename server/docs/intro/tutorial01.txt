============================================
Deploying your first package with Bombardier
============================================

Let's learn by example.

   :alt: Basic network configuration

In this example, we're going to take a network as shown above and
configure all the servers on it for SNMP. Here's what you're going to
need before you start this tutorial:

  * A Linux or cygwin 1.5 or 1.7 computer that will act as the
    Bombardier server

  * A Redhat 4 or CentOS 4 computer that you want to configure SNMP on
    using a Bomabardier package.

We'll assume you have :ref:`Bombardier installed <intro-install>`
already. You can tell Bombardier is installed by running the
interactive interpreter and typing ``import bombardier_server``. If
that command runs successfully, with no errors, Bombardier server is
installed.

.. admonition:: Where to get help:

    If you're having trouble going through this tutorial, please post
    a message to `bombardier-users`__ chat with other Bombardier users
    who might be able to help.

Starting the server
===================

If this is your first time using Bomabardie, you'll have to take care of some
initial setup. Namely, you'll need to set up the basic repository
database and an SVN server.
