============================================
Deploying your first package with Bombardier
============================================

Let's learn by example.  Refer to the diagram below for what the
network will look like in general.  If your network doesn't look
exactly like this, that's okay.  Interpret the instructions for
your environment.

   :alt: Basic network configuration

In this example, we're going to take a network as shown above and
configure all the servers on it for SNMP. Here's what you're going to
need before you start this tutorial:

  * A Redhat 5, Ubuntu Hardy, or cygwin 1.5 or 1.7 computer that will
    act as the Bombardier server

  * A Redhat 5 or CentOS 5 computer that you want to configure SNMP on
    using a Bomabardier package.

We'll assume you have :ref:`Bombardier installed <intro-install>`
already. You can tell Bombardier is installed by running the
interactive interpreter and typing ``import bombardier_server``. If
that command runs successfully, with no errors, Bombardier server is
installed.

.. admonition:: Where to get help:

    If you're having trouble going through this tutorial, please post
    a message to `bombardier-users`__ to interact with other
    Bombardier users who might be able to help.

Setting up the server
=====================

If this is your first time using Bomabardier, you'll have to take care
of some initial setup.  Namely, you'll need to set up the basic
repository database, directory structure, and configuration key.
You'll do this using the bdr_server_quickstart script::


  $ bdr_server_quickstart
  Perform initial Bombardier Server environment setup? (y/n): y
  Where do you want the root of your repository? [/var/deploy]:

  Creating directory structure in /var/deploy...

  Bombardier Server requires the public SSH DSA key to be stored
  in the %s directory.
  Using the one in root's home directory..."

  Creating repository in /var/deploy/cmdb...
  Created a standalone tree (format: 2a)
  added /var/deploy/cmdb/package
  added /var/deploy/cmdb/machine
  added /var/deploy/cmdb/bom
  added /var/deploy/cmdb/include
  Committing to: /var/deploy/cmdb/
  added bom
  added include
  added machine
  added package
  Committed revision 1.

  You will need to set your configuration key as part of the setup process.
  This key will be used to encrypt sensitive configuration items.
  Please enter your configuration key:
  Please re-enter your configuration key:
  Writing configuration to /etc/bombardier.yml...

  Basic server setup complete.
  Now configure your web server according to the instructions
  in your documentation.
