<h1>Jan 10 - Release 0.223</h1>

<ol>

<li> The web server has been completely refactored to use the web
     service to interact with data. This places the entire web server
     on a much more sound RESTful footing, as well as providing a
     basis for developing unit tests.

<li> Found the root cause of memory leaking and implemented a
     short-term change to keep the problem overwhelming a system

</ol>

<h1>December 23 - Release 0.221</h1>

<ol>

<li> Fixed installation locking. Now the system will not clear the
     installation lock after a failed cleanup call.

<li> <strong>Begun</strong> work factoring out a web service on the
     web GUI. 

<li> Numerous minor bugfixes, but there still appears to be a problem
     right now with package dependency installation ordering.
</ol>

<h1>December 15 - Release 0.220</h1>

New release features

<ol>

<li> The installer now creates a "drillbit" user as a local
     administrator and always use that for future login attempts.

<li> No more "type" for a client. You will now select a list of BOMs,
     of which "base" can be one.

<li> Fleshed out the server content, basic pages, and forms. Refactored
     where necessary to provide for a scaleable architecture.

<li> Log management: have the logs that bombardier produces be managable.
     Have them roll periodically, and don't put so much crap in them all
     the time

<li> Minimal client: Installation is simplified, and is more
     "end-user" focused. Allows user to select packages "a-la-carte"

<li> Server-side UI for a-la-carte client package selection and
     configuration. 

<li> Package specification 0.5 has been <a href=./packagespec>
     released.</a> All packages must advertise their configuration
     options as part of their package.ini file. Any packages without
     configuration information will be assumed not no need
     configuration. Packages must also include a "Platform" tag which
     specifies the platform for the package. Any package without a
     platform tag will be assumed to be platform-independent, but
     would prefer "ALL" keyword for independent packages.

<li> Integration of the website with the client: packages are selected
     from the web site for a-la-carte mode. This also drives forward
     client configuration on the website as well. 

<li> A-la-carte feature: User is directed toward the repository server
     if they have no .ini file for a-la-carte installation. This would
     allow the user to pick their package groups.

</ol>

<h1>New packages</h1>


<ol>

<li> <strong>Excel and Access 2000</strong> have finally gotten
     stable.
