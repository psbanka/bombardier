Bombardier is a centralized, cross-platform package deployment,
configuration and change management system.

All documentation is in the "docs" directory. If you're just getting
started, here's how we recommend you read the docs:

    * First, read docs/intro/install.txt for instructions on
      installing the Bombardier server. 

    * Next, work through the tutorials in order (docs/intro/tutorial01.txt,
      docs/intro/tutorial02.txt, etc.).

    * You'll probably want to read through the topical guides (in docs/topics)
      next; from there you can jump to the HOWTOs (in docs/howto) for specific
      problems, and check out the reference (docs/ref) for gory details.

Docs are updated rigorously. If you find any problems in the docs, or think they
should be clarified in any way, please take 30 seconds to fill out a ticket
here:
