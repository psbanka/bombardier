<h2>Why does this project exist?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-does-this-project-exist" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Bombardier grew from a company that provided key-control products to
Real Estate Agents (these are in the form of little boxes that hang on
people&#8217;s doors when they want to sell their houses and keys that all
Real Estate Agents hold to access the key housed in the little
box). One of the features of these key-control products was that it
was possible to get information about what boxes a given Real-estate
agent opened. In addition, it was possible to turn off a key quickly
so that a Real Estate Agent who was not longer in good standing
couldn&#8217;t open the boxes and gain access to the houses being sold.</p>
<p>To facilitate some of these features, the key-control products
required a datacenter back-end which communicated with the keys to
find out and report what boxes were opened and which could authorize
keys to access key-boxes for the next day. In addition, there were a
large variety of other network-based software services: web-based
portals, interactive voice-response, TCP-based socket servers,
client-server applications fronted by VPN components; as well as
numerous infrastructure components to make everything work: DNS,
email, load balancing, and database backend.</p>
<p>Because this datacenter infrastructure was part of a product that
provided people with access to a large number of homes in various
geographic areas, it was critical that the datacenter infrastructure
be deployed properly each and every time to large numbers of
servers. Furthermore, there was a large software development group
which was constantly releasing improvements and patches to the backend
software, and so this datacenter had to be able to accomodate change
quickly as well.</p>
<p>Bombardier was developed to manage this infrastructure: to get a
concrete idea of what software was being deployed on what servers in a
single <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definitive_Software_Library">Definitive Software Library</a> , to centralize all software
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_item">Configuration Items</a>, and to be able to deploy software correctly
every time. Implementing Bombardier in this environment decreased the
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incident_Management_%28ITSM%29">Incidents</a> to the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Technology_Infrastructure_Library#Service_Desk">Service Desk</a> by 90% and increased speed of
deployment by 90%.</p>
<p>After the success of the team in managing software releases in the
Real Estate field, the same IT team was assigned in 2006 to a new
product which dealt with identifying and tracking any tampering to
shipping containers coming into and out of the United States. This
product also had a substantial back-end datacenter with even higher
security requirements. We tried to find any products that were at all
similar to the Bombardier that could be used instead of writing our
own software, but could find nothing that came close. Therefore
Bombardier was extended and enhanced, providing it with much more of a
Linux focus, a streamlined command-line interface, locked-down
security protocols, and other features. All these features rolled into
the 0.70 release, which was released to open source under the GPLv2
license.</p>
<p>This venture was audited by several large companies, including
undergoing a successful abbreviated ISO 17799 audit by Siemens CERT,
which deemed that the system &#8220;...provides an appropriate and
acceptable level of IT security.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since then, the software has been used on other products within the
company, gradually becoming more secure, more modular, and easier to
use.</p>

<h2>What does &#8220;Bombardier&#8221; mean, and how do you pronounce it?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-does-bombardier-mean-and-how-do-you-pronounce-it" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>One of the goals of Bombardier was to apply some concepts of
Manufacturing Engineering to Software as a Service. On a factory line,
every product has a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_materials">Bill of Materials</a>, which &#8220;is a list of the raw
materials, sub-assemblies, intermediate assemblies, sub-components,
components, parts and the quantities of each needed to manufacture an
end item.&#8221; And we thought to ourselves, &#8220;Why should servers in a
datacenter be any different? This software is just as critical to our
customers as the widgets that they purchase, and yet we manage
software deployment and changes in a much different way.&#8221; We therefore
had the belief that every server should have a Bill of Materials or
&#8220;BOM.&#8221; Hence, the name &#8220;Bombardier&#8221; comes from this term: it&#8217;s the
software that ensures that all servers comply with their BOMs.</p>
<p>Furthermore, many datacenter administrators treat their work like
ground warfare: send in a platoon of system administrators to pore
over each and every configuration option and setting within those
systems to make sure they&#8217;re correct. Whereas our viewpoint is that
system administrators should hardly ever log on to an individual
server, and should <strong>never</strong> make any changes to a server ad-hoc. All
changes to servers should be done with packages so that the changes
are well-documented and reversible. Therefore, managing a datacenter
chagne using Bombardier is much more like strategic air-strikes: from
a centralized console, pick your packages and deploy them to (usually
large amounts of) servers, and sit back and watch things happen.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re American English speakers, so we pronounce Bombardier as
bom-buh-<strong>DEER</strong>. If you&#8217;re a French feller and want to pronounce it
bom-bahr-<strong>DYEY</strong>, then that&#8217;s up to you.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also an <a class="reference external" href="http://cache.lexico.com/dictionary/audio/lunaWAV/B04/B0477000.wav">audio clip of the pronunciation</a>.</p>

<h2>What platforms does Bombardier run on?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-platforms-does-bombardier-run-on" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Bombardier runs on Linux (specifically tested with Ubuntu Hardy,
RedHat Enterprise Linux 4, and Centos 4). It will probably run on
cygwin without much difficulty and other flavors of Linux, but we
haven&#8217;t had much need to test this in the past year or two. Anyone
interested in testing Bombardier on other platforms and flavors of
Linux is welcome to do so, and we&#8217;ll gladly help you iron out any
issues that may arise.</p>
<p>Bombardier uses SSH to communicate between the centralized server
system and the individual machines that it manages. Therefore the
remote boxes have to be capable of at least running ssh and providing
a bash prompt.</p>

Banka and Shawn Sherwood. We welcome additional contributors.</p>
